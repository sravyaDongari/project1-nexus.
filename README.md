Continuously monitor and improve user experience based on user feedback.
In summary, the development of the login and sign-up pages demonstrates our commitment to creating a robust and user-friendly web application. The collaborative effort of the development team has resulted in a secure and efficient authentication system that sets a solid foundation for the overall success of our project

Sure, let's document the provided HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

### HTML Structure:

The HTML structure defines a login and signup form within a container. The page includes links to external CSS and JavaScript files and uses the Boxicons CSS library.

#### Meta Tags:
- `charset="UTF-8"`: Sets the character encoding to UTF-8.
- `http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible"`: Specifies the document mode and browser compatibility.
- `name="viewport"`: Defines the viewport properties for responsive design.

#### CSS and JavaScript Links:
- External CSS file: `file:///Users/sravya/Desktop/project1-nexus/nexus.css`
- Boxicons CSS library: Linked from `https://unpkg.com/boxicons@2.1.2/css/boxicons.min.css`
- External JavaScript file: file:`file:///Users/sravya/Desktop/project1-nexus/nexus.js`


#### Body Section:
- Contains a container with login and signup forms.
- Forms are divided into login and signup sections.

### CSS Styling (from `nexus.css`):

The CSS file contains styles for creating a responsive login and signup form with various input fields, buttons, and media options.

#### Key Styles:
- Font: Poppins from Google Fonts is imported.
- Responsive container with a blanchedalmond background color.
- Login and signup forms with styling for input fields, buttons, and links.
- Eye icon for password visibility toggle.
- Media options for login with Facebook and Google.

### JavaScript Functionality (from `nexus.js`):

The JavaScript file adds functionality to the login and signup forms.

#### Key Functionalities:
1. **Password Visibility Toggle:**
   - Clicking on the eye icon toggles password visibility for all password fields.

2. **Form Switching:**
   - Clicking on the "Signup" or "Login" links switches between the login and signup forms.

3. **Login Form Submission:**
   - Prevents the default form submission behavior.
   - Checks if the entered password matches the first six letters of the email.
   - Displays an alert for successful or failed login.

### Responsive Design:
- The CSS includes media queries for screens with a maximum width of 400px, adjusting the form padding.

### Notes:
- The paths to external files and images are specified using local file paths, which might cause issues if the project is deployed online.
- The provided Google logo image path seems to be incomplete or missing.

### Recommendations:
- Use relative paths or deploy the project online to ensure proper file access.
- Ensure the availability of the specified Google logo image or replace it with a valid path.

Remember that the code documentation may need to be adapted based on future updates or changes to the codebase.
